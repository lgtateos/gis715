     <p><strong>Course focus: </strong>This course will focus on visualization theory and  interface design for geospatial analytics. </p>
     <!--  <P><I>Topics are based on a typical GIS workflow</I>:   Data Acquisition -&gt; Integration -&gt;  GIS database development -&gt; Geospatial Analysis -&gt;Visualization  -&gt; Geospatial Modeling -&gt; Decision Support and Management   <p><b>Learning Goals and Objectives</b></p>  </P>  -->
     <p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: None</p>
     <p><strong>Educational Approach:</strong> This course will consist mainly of  textbook and online readings and online assignments and homework exercises, </p>
     <hr />
     <p><strong>Textbooks: </strong> </p>
     <p>Ware, Colin. <em>Information visualization: perception for design</em>. Elsevier, 2013.  (Available as an        e-book through the NC State library, unlimited downloads.)<br />
       <br />
         <em>Visualization Analysis and Design </em>by Tamara  Munzner (Available as an        e-book through the NC State library online--or with a limited number of pages downloaded/day)&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><br />
      </strong></p>
     <hr />
     <p><strong>Homework </strong>Reading,   tutorials, and other assignments (such as software installations or   experiments to be completed outside of class) will be assigned on a   weekly basis.  Student will keep a journal chronicling their work.  S/U grades will be assigned at the end of the semester based on homework completion and class participation.</p>
     <hr />
     <p><strong>Grading: this course is Credit-only</strong></p>
     <p>Grades will be based on homework assignments. </p>
     <p>The   student's performance in a credit-only course will be reported as S or U. S, is the satisfactory grade for credit-only course and given when course work is   equivalent to C- (70%) or better.  U means no credit grade for a credit-only   course. The grade for a credit-only course will have no effect on the   student's grade point average. Credit hours for the credit-only course   will be counted in the cumulative hours attempted.</p>
     <p>Credit-only courses do not count in the calculation of eligibility for the Semester Dean's List. (See Academic Honors)</p>
     <p>All   courses on a graduate student's Plan of Work must be taken for letter   grade except those courses authorized to be graded S/U.</p>
     <p>Students   should be aware that many graduate and professional schools evaluate   credit-only courses for which U grades were awarded as failing grades.</p>
     <hr />
     <p><strong>Accommodation of students with disabilities: </strong>Reasonable accommodations will be made for  students with verifiable disabilities.   In order to take advantage of available accommodations, students must  register with Disability Services for Students at 1900 Student Health   Center, Campus Box 7509,  515-7653.  For more information on NC  State's policy on working with students with disabilities, please see <a href="http://www.ncsu.edu/provost/offices/affirm_action/dss/"> the university provisions and policies for disabled students</a></p>
     <hr />
     <p><strong>Attendance policy:</strong> This is a very intensive course as you will be  learning highly technical skills and learning new ways to conceptualize and  analyze GIS problems.  Therefore, I am  taking very seriously your instructions to be at every class. If you must miss a class it is your responsibility to make up the material. See also <a href="http://policies.ncsu.edu/regulation/reg-02-20-03">university attendance regulations and university definitions of excused absences. </a></p>
     <hr />
     <p><strong>Class evaluations online:</strong> <a href="https://classeval.ncsu.edu">Online class evaluations</a> will be available for students to complete  during the last week of class. Students will receive an email message directing them  to a website where they can login using their Unity ID and complete  evaluations.  All evaluations are  confidential; instructors will never know how any one student responded to any  question, and students will never know the ratings for any particular  instructors. For additional information write to the student help desk:   classeval@ncsu.edu</p>
     <hr />
     <p><strong> Audit: </strong> Audit  students  must complete all homework assignments and quizzes/exams with a 70% total average score.  That is, they do not have to complete the project. <br />
     </p>
     <hr />
     <p><strong>Mailing list and website: </strong>Student unity email address will be added or deleted from the course mailing list  automatically based on registration status in the course. Neither the TAs nor the  instructor can add non-unity address to the mailing list. Students are responsible for announcements sent to the unity email address. <a href="http://help.ncsu.edu/solutions/all/22.php">Set up mail forwarding</a>, if necessary. </p>
     <p>Updates to the online schedule will be made during the semester. </p>
     <hr />
     <p><strong>“Withdrawal”                   and “Incomplete” Polices: </strong>Any student who enrolls,                   but does not complete the course work or process a withdrawal form before                   the end of the University’s official drop period for the semester will                   receive a 0, unless they initiate one of the following options: </p>
     <blockquote>
       <p>a. The student                       is passing and officially drops the course after six weeks. In this                       case the student will be given a “W”. Passing this course is defined                       as having earned an average grade in the course of a C or above                       on the date of the student’s request for the “W”. This option will                       only be available in keeping with the current NCSU policy. </p>
       <p>b. The student                       receives an “I”. This grade will be given only in special documented                       circumstances when a student, for some serious reason, cannot complete                       the course by the required deadline. An “I” will be given only if                       the student has completed at least 80% of the course. An “I” cannot                       be used to simply avoid a 0 grade. All work to complete the course                       must be finished by the end of the next semester or the “I” will be                       changed to a 0 grade. This option will only be available in keeping                       with the current NCSU policy. </p>

     <p><strong>Withdrawal                   for Behavior that Interferes with the Instructional Process: </strong> Interactions in this class are expected to be professional and courteous. Disruptive                   behavior, which impedes the teaching/learning process for other students, will not be tolerated.                   An instructor may withdraw a student for disruptive behavior that is                   interfering with the instructional process (such as students using portable                   phones or radios, or harassing faculty or other students on forums or in person). For further                   information see “Students Rights, Responsibilities, and Conduct” in                   the NCSU catalog. </p>
     <p>Please make sure                   you fully understand this agreement as you will be held to the entire                   policy as stated above. </p>
